description: For this project a client from Sanson Estate Winery wanted a brochure made 
as a giveaway for tours, or as something that could be grabbed while at the 
main building. The brochure is just to provide a brief discription about them 
and what they do. All imagery and logoâ€™s were provided. The client by request 
asked that there was at least picture of their cows and one of their pigs. With 
that came a small challenge as the photo of cows had a wired fence going right 
through the picture which was asked to be removed. With a little photo editing, 
its now like there was never a fence in the photo to begin with.

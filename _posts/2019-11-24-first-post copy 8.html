description: This was an open ended project, we were free to design a poster based on a current or 
made up film. So for this I did my design based off a post-apocolyptic movie called 
“Rebbot”. This was an interesting piece as there were a lot of elements that needed to 
go into making this a believable movie poster. But over all this was a fun project to 
take on.

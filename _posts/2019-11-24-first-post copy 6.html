description:  For this I was asked to design a small news letter about typography and typography artists. 
Not only did I need to make a news letter, I was also asked to create a logo as well. Using 
diagonals and using modern patterning I created this fun design that engages with the viewer 
as they read text that has been titled on an odd angle and bold colours that drawâ€™s your 
attention to each section.

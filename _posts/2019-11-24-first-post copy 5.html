description: For this project the fashion program asked the students of the graphic design program 
to create for them posters, tickets, and other layouts for extra information to help 
them advertise their show visually in the community and around campus. Their theme for 
that years fashion show was nature, with a color pallete subjected to the warm and 
vibrant colors you would find in nature. If you look closely at the wood design, you 
will see a models face forming at the top tying back to the fashion show. There was a 
great deal of information that needed to be organized into a digestable layout, it was 
a challenging, but fun project to take on.

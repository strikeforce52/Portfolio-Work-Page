description: For this I was asked to design a layout for St. Clairâ€™s 2018 anuual report. 
My job was to take an overwhelming amount of text content and break it down 
into something more digestiful and organized. From prices to graphs, to bios 
there was no shortage in the variety of info that needed to be broken down. 
To compliment each section I included geometric shapes to bring life to the 
dull content and imagery that represented each section to also provide a visual 
aspect to understand what the content is about in each individual section. 
This was a fun  challenge to tackle and surely will not be the last.

description: For this project I was asked to create a dog food package and come up with a logo design. 
The target market for this brand was large dogs who goes on a lot of hikes and trips with 
their owners in the wilderness. So to capture that I created a logo that was messy, rough, 
and broken to represent that messy and agressiveness of a dog wondering through the wild. 
The colors by choice are bold and ment to leave the impression that this is not a cheap brand. 
This is high end dog food, with all the nutrients theyâ€™ll need to remain healthy and strong.

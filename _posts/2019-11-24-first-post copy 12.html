description: For this project I had to create an entire brand for a fictional all womans 
sports wear company. For this project I needed to design them a logo, magazine 
ad, trades show mockup, brochure, and an entire stationary set. I choose to make 
the logo icon a lotus flower because the lotus resembles strength and perseverance 
and continues to grow under difficult conditions. This relates very much to when 
you train or are exercising to obtain a set goal. The logo is both feminine and 
meaningful, but with a modern twist.

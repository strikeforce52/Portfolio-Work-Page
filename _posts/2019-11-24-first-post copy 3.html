description:  For this project I had to create a brand around a fictional carbonized energy 
ice tea beverage. I needed to create a logo, social media post, billboard, and 
bottle design. In the logo I made the “z” in Teaz into a lightning bolt to 
symbolize the energy that the drink should be bringing to anyone who consumes it. 
Everything from the colors to the cog all work together to inform consumers this 
is a energy boosting drink, that will give you that edge you need when studying 
overnight or after that long day at work. Its that sip of paradise that will take 
you from a rainy day in the city, to a sunny sandy beach.

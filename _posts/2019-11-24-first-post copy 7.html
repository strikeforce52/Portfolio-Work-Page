description: This project was open ended, so I had the opportunity to  create whatever I 
wanted for a magazine design. For this I was responsible to create the title 
page, a two page spreade, and a table of contents. EPSY means to catch sight 
of (something that is distant, partially hidden, or obscure); glimpse. Which 
I thought was perfect for a travel magazine. I wanted something new, modern, 
and unique. So I played with harsh angles and geometric patterns to organize 
and showcase that this is a modern travel magazine for todays adventures.

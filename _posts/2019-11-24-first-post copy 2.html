description: For this I was asked to design a brand standards booklet for the Downtown Windsor BIA. 
In this I needed to include a variety of things including logo minimum sizes, logo protective 
space, colour application, incorrect usage of logo, colour palette, typography, envelope 
dimensions, business card dimensions, letterhead dimensions, photography requirements, social 
media post layouts, and icongraphy for an app or website. It was fun project to take on, having 
the opportunity to design a wide range of elements.

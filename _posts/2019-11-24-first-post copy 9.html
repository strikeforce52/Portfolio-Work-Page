description: For this I was asked to design the package design that would wrap around a can for Coca Cola. 
The challenge was to create a Halloween themed design for their new flavour. For this design 
I wanted to make sure the elements took the attention of both kids and adults. To grab the 
attention of children I put elements like candy and an orange slice for the moon and for the 
adults the zombie hand popping out from the ground. The design in general is simple and vectored 
so that it keeps true to being inviting to both child and adult audiences.
